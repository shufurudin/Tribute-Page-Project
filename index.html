                        Asashoryu Akinori is his <em>rikishi</em> name and he is natural from Mongolia. He has a strong background on the fight scene, his father and their old brothers achieved high ranks in the mongolian wrestling sport, since young Asashoryu practiced this sport and Judo later.
                        <br>
                        He was one the most successful rikishi in the hole <em>sumo</em> history, being the first Mongolian to rise at the highest rank of sumo (Yokozuna) and the first rikishi to win all the 6 <em>bashos</em> in the year!
                        <br>
                        He won 25 top division tournament championships, putting him in the fourth place of all time in the sport.

                    <div class="img-right"></div>
                    <p>
                        But he is more like a anti-hero than a hero. Asashoryu was envolve in a lot of miss conducts, in the <em>dohyo</em>, for example, he was the first Yokozuna to receive a <em>hansoku-make</em> in a bout, out the dohyo unfortunately he made several bad actions from be seen without dressing the typical <em>kimono</em> until aggressions and drunking.

                <div class="img-left2"></div>
                <p>Asashoryu had a hard discipline and dedication on <em>keiko</em>, making several repetitions with dumbbells of 30kgs, lifting 200kgs on chest press and carring a big bowl with concrete during his <em>suriashi</em>.
                <br>
                His style of sumo is impressive, even being considered a light weight in sumo he was ever confident in their strong and speed, giving to him a wide pool of techniques. Technically speaking, his style of sumo is considered a <em>migi-yotsu</em> when gripped on the <em>mawashi</em> of his opponent and <em>tsuppari</em> when in ranged.
                <br>
                Due his impetuous fight spirit, very often threw the opponent with a peculiar trow. He mark 45 different <em>kimarite</em> during his carrer, a really big number in comparision with others rikishis with same level.
