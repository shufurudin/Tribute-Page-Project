            Asashoryu Akinori is his <em>rikishi</em> name and he is natural from Mongolia.
            He was one the most successful rikishi in the hole <em>sumo</em> history, being the first Mongolian to rise at the highest rank of sumo (Yokozuna) and the first rikishi to win all 6 <em>bashos</em> in a row!

            But he is more like a anti-hero than a hero. Asashoryu was envolve in a lot of miss conducts, in the <em>dohyo</em>, for example, he was the first Yokozuna to receive a <em>hansoku-make</em> in a bout and out the dohyo unfortunately he made several bad actions from be seen without dressing the typical <em>kimono</em> until aggressions and drunking.
